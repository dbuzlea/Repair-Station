Dear Mindi, 

	When I first started my journey at Apple, you were my first connection leader. One of the

Dear Jeff, 

	Although it may seem like we never got along in the repair room, or that we both never
	agreed on much, the one thing that I think we both can agree on is our love for what this company 
	stands for. A culture of open-mindedness, full of passionate team members from all walks of the earth,
	who wont accept the world for what it is and instead challenge the status quo. One of the most prominent
	memories I have in the GR is our conversations, however heated or frustrating they may have seemed, they 
	always have challenged my way of thinking and in some cases have checked my logic and ego. One of my main
	philosophies in life is constant growth in my day to day interactions. I like to think that our conversations
	have lead to personal growth for the both of us. I hope we keep in touch, and the next time you hear 'If I Can 
	Turn Back Time' by Cher,or any ColdPlay song, you think of me!
