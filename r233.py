Dear Mike, 

	There has never been a human personified leader in my eyes until I first met you. You have

	has resonated within the store. I will truly miss my time we got to work together and will forever keep
	that "yesh!" spirit intact when roaming the halls at Apple Park.

Dear Brent, 

	A lot of what I have accomplished throughout my journey here at Apple has been accredited to
